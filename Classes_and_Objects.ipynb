In python, the definition of an object is rather loose. An object is anything which can be assigned to a variable or passed as an argument to a function. So pretty much...EVERYTHING IN PYTHON IS AN OBJECT. Strings, lists, dictionaries, integers, functions, floats, modules are all objects.\n",

    "So everything in python must be a type of an object. For example, the type of object that something like [1,2,3] would be is a list... So how do we check the type of an object? We can use the **type()** function to check the type of object that something is."

    "# Classes and Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will be talking about python *classes* and *objects*. Classes are a logical collection of attributes (data) and methods (functions), and objects are instances of classes. For example, we can have a class called **SchoolTeacher**. Our **SchoolTeacher** class can have attributes for the grade that they teach, the subject that they teach, and the months that they work (teachers get summers off). Our **SchoolTeacher** class can also have a method to calculate a teacher's salary using its attributes. From our **SchoolTeacher** class, we can create an instance (also known as an *instance object*) called **Mr_Jones**. This process of creating instances from classes is called *object instantiation*. \n",
    "\n",
    "So let's break this down into easier terms. You can think of a class as a noun. In our example, our noun is **SchoolTeacher**, meant to represent school teachers. Next, you can think of attributes as adjectives. Attributes are the data that describe our noun (class). Next, you can think of methods as verbs. Methods are actions that are performed by our noun (class). Lastly, the process of creating an instance from a class (object instantiation) can be thought of as giving life to our class. We gave life to our **SchoolTeacher** class by creating an instance called **Mr_Jones**. \n",

    "            statements\n",

    "As you can see, creating attributes for our class are simple, we just assign a variable to a value within the body of our class. In order to create a method, we create a function within our class body. Let's see an example below where we create our **SchoolTeacher** class. For now, do not worry about the **self** parameter within the method arguments."

It does not have to be **self**, but everyone else will be using **self**, and so should you.
