    "# Polymorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "**Polymorphism** is the ability for an object to be processed differently for different data types. Consider the addition operator, **+**. When used with numbers, it can add two numbers together. However, when used with two strings, it concatenates the two strings. This is an example of polymorphism, the addition operator is processed differently based upon whether it is being used on numbers of strings. Typically, polymorphism will exist with methods. A method may act one way in one class, but produce a different function in another class.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to completely understand polymorphism, it is necessary for us to understand what **overriding** is. **Overriding** is when a derived class inherits methods from a base class, but the methods do not behave the same way in the derived class as it did in the base class. The derived class has the ability to change the behavior of how the method by redefining it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we have an example where we create a class called **Professor**. The **Professor** class will be our base class. It will have one method called **set_num_classes**. This method will create an attribute called **num_classes** and give it a value of 3."
