    "# Abstraction and Encapsulation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will learn about the first two pillars of Object Oriented Programming (OOP), **Abstraction** and **Encapsulation**. Encapsulation is the process of concealing implementation details from the user. For example, when you create a function, the statements within the function are hidden within the function body. In OOP, this is done by creating methods. In the methods you create, there are a set of statements within the method body that perform the method function. These statements are hidden from the user when the method is called upon. Abstraction is very closely related to encapsulation - abstraction is the representation of the encapsulated details. Abstraction deals with things on a design level, letting you worry about what an object does, rather than how an object does it. When you call on a method, you are abstracting the methods function, without worrying about the details that are encapsulated. Abstraction and encapsulation are very tightly knit. You can think of abstraction as an outer view of an object, while encapsulation is the inner view of an object.\n",
