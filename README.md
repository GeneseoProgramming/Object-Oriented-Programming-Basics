# Object-Oriented-Programming-Basics

This repository was made to teach members about the basics of Object Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python 3. This repository contains notebooks meant to teach the four pillars of OOP: Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism. 

The following notebooks were written by Joseph Tadros: Classes_and_Objects, Abstraction_ad_Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism. Edits to these notebooks may have been, and hopefully have been, made since the initial upload. For the most efficient learning, follow the order of notebooks below.

1. Classes_and_Objects
2. Abstraction_and_Encapsulation
